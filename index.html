  my love 💕  
  
 From the moment you came into my life, everything started feeling more beautiful and meaningful. You are not just a person to me, you are my comfort, my happiness, and my safest place. Every smile of yours makes my heart melt, and every word you say stays with me. I don’t know what I did to deserve someone as kind, caring, and special as you, but I am truly grateful for you every single day. You make my world brighter, my days lighter, and my heart fuller. No matter what happens, I want you to know that I will always stand by your side, support you, and cherish you with all my heart. Thank you for being you, for loving me, and for making my life so incredibly beautiful  
 I’m so lucky to have you.  
 Thank you for being you
I love you always and forever    ✨  
  </p>
